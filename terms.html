          By creating a FixItZed account or using our mobile and web products, you
          agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any additional guidelines we

        <h2>2. The FixItZed Platform</h2>
        <p>
          FixItZed connects customers with third-party service providers (“fixers”).
          We facilitate discovery, scheduling, communication, and payments but do not
          directly provide the services listed by fixers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customers are responsible for vetting fixers and reviewing ratings.</li>
          <li>
            Fixers are independent contractors who must comply with all applicable
            laws, licensing, and insurance requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>

          securely through the app. Cancellation, refund, or dispute processes are
